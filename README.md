# AQI Predictor — Mumbai 

AQI Predictor is a small machine learning project that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Mumbai from pollutant measurements (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3) and exposes an interactive Streamlit dashboard. The dashboard shows the predicted AQI, pollutant impact and an AQI gauge visualized with Plotly.

Quick highlights
- Input features: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3
- ML model: Multiple Linear Regression
- Dashboard: Streamlit app with Plotly charts (AQI gauge)
